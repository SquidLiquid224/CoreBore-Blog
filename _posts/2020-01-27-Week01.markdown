During my first week of this learning module I took part in the Global Game Jam.  This is the fourth time I have participated in the Jam and have yet to have a bad experience.  Over the past years I have made friends through this event with like minded game development interests.  Needless to say I was looking forward to collaborating with them again.  Although this Game Jam is just for fun and networking I saw this as an opportunity to build a prototype for a game that I could use throughout this learning module.  

   The Theme for the Game Jam was “Repair”, and our team started brainstorming Ideas.  I was lucky enough to have my idea supported by the group so I started sketching up some concepts. What made this Jam so unique to me is that my concept sketches are almost exactly what the end project became.  I have posted both the initial concept and final game jam prototype below.  
   With this Prototype we began play testing on the final day of the Jam.  It was a success! Everyone that played the game enjoyed the experience as well as gave some useful feedback.
   
One comment that was made multiple times was that the gameplay was too tiring. With our efforts to create a game with urgency we may have short sighted the overall user experience.  Going forward I would like to make improvements to this area by creating time of rest throughout the game. Another piece of user feedback I found very interesting was when a fellow jamer stated “I don’t want to play the game because there is no reward at the end”. In light of this I would like to build on the ending of the game, giving the player more motivation to play and win. 

I plan to use this user feedback to improve the game play throughout the first development sprint of the module.
