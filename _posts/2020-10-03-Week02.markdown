Game Synopsis   
   
Duck runner is a Hyper Casual game with a up beat sound track.  Dodge as many walls as you can and claim the high-score!
  
Research and Development  
  
My reseach for this game begain on Udemy I wanted a straight forward game project to get my create energy flowing.  I chose a simple course that walks you through an Endless Runner game from start to finsh using the Unity game engine.  I was able to create the prototype within an evening and began customzing.   
During an earilier duck game I produced I created the perfect running duck animation. I decided to use the asset as well as a music track I had purchsed for use during my game streams.  With some tranparencies applied to the objects and a nice atmospheric fog I had a custom prototype to work with. 
Now the qestion was, where to go from here.  
I need multiple levels and a game that increases difficulty. I found a white paper that explains Procedural Level balacing in Runner Rames that seemed interesting.  Also, having used a sound track built with game loops allow for some very interesting sound design work.

Critical Reflection  
  
In relfection to the prototype as far, I feel it lacks originality.  As I move forward with new prototypes I plan to be moretopical and create more layers of interest in the design.  I hope that through the next project I will come up with an idea to enhance Duck Runner.
