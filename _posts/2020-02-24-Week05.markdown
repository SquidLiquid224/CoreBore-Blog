title: Week 05 - Concept Art - Final style and locations
date: Febuary 24, 2020

 Week 05 was an amazing week in the progression of my artistic endeavors.  At this point I became confident in my skills with ProCreate and painted up some location designs that I was proud of.  The concepts I sketched the week before evolved into colour pieces that I can use in the game intro.  All I need now to create my Intro narrative are character sketches, a task I am saving for Week 07, when I will have plenty of time to sit back and draw.  I feel this intro is a very high priority to achieve the robust character filled game I have in mind. 

Another task that I have been postponing was creating this blog.. Although a crucial tool for feedback and building a fan base I needed a clear vision before I broke into web development. 
As you are probably aware of, I decided to build this site on Github Pages.  It seemed like a logical decision because I hold a GitHub Pro subscription and tech-savvy enough to develop some Markdown code. 
To my surprise building a website on Github pages was not at all as streamlined as I expected.  I ran into a lot of issues even when following the documentation. I resorted to some helpful “Youtuber” that made a very helpful tutorial video.  I also encountered a path error on my image files that involved some lengthy debugging.  In the end I had the site up and ready to populate, it will make for the bases of my progress video that I am excited to produce next week. 

Well back to the topic of concept art.  Concept art has always been a passion of mine and having the chance to reconnect with my roots was wonderful.  I plan to conceptualize different planets and missions for Core Bore but first of all I need to get this game ready to upload to Steam, an endeavour I begin next week.
