Preliminary Work  

I began my reseach for the dissemication plan through Facebook and testing the marketing aspects of that platform. I found that creating ad campaigns are quick and easy to create at a resonable price.  After my initial testing on a Game Video Creator account I built a company page called Original Games and began an test ad campaign to find my audience.  I also found some very useful resources on the Business At [Facebook Learn](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn).  By going through this resourse I found some really good take-aways and was inspired to set up a Facebook Organization Page.  I needed to establish a presence as soon as possible and conduct more ad reseach so when my MVP is complete my ads will be effective and taget the right audience.

Task 2: Audience Research  

If you have not done so already, carry out audience research to test assumptions about the target audience and their attitudes, knowledge, interests, preferences, or behaviours relevant to your FMP. Be sure to reference your findings within the dissemination plan.  

Dissemination Report:  

The dissemination plan must be no longer than 15 pages long (excluding references and appendix). The structure of the dissemination plan will differ depending on the product, audience and target market amongst other things. Here is a suggested structure for a tradition app. It is up to you whether to add or remove sections.
