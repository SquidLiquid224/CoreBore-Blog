### **Preliminary Work**  

I began my reseach for the dissemication plan through Facebook and testing the marketing aspects of that platform. I found that creating ad campaigns are quick and easy to create at a resonable price.  After my initial testing on a Game Video Creator account I built a company page called Original Games and began an test ad campaign to find my audience.  I also found some very useful resources on the Business At [Facebook Learn](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn).  By going through this resourse I found some really good take-aways and was inspired to set up a Facebook Organization Page.  I needed to establish a presence as soon as possible and conduct more ad reseach so when my MVP is complete my ads will be effective and taget the right audience. i started the page [Original Games](https://www.facebook.com/Original-Games-104498631430111).  With this created I began my research on other competitors that are also leveraging the Facebook advertisement platform. 

### **Competitor Case Studies**

I chose to do my competitor case studies based on successfull Facebook ad campaigns.  As my games will be short web based games and share many qualities to the following examples and I have also chosen to use the facebook ad platform as my main outlet for marketing and publicity.  
   
[FoxNext Games](https://www.facebook.com/business/success/foxnext-games)

FoxNext Games was my first case study, they put together some really effective Facebook Ad campaigns for their Game Marvel Strike Force. What jumped out to me was the use of Carousel Ads, using this style of side scolling ad you can showcase multiple titles in one ad, it also makes the ad more interactive for the user.  According to the success story artical after implementing a carousel ad they saw a 6% higher return on ad spend, 61% more app installs, 14% more revenue and a 33% lower average cost per install.  With my project being a series of smaller games titles this ad campaign might work well.  
 As I dove deeping into their ad campaigns I noticed that FoxNext pivoted to Emoji based voting ads, this model looks like a great way to get a customer engaged in the ad. This interactivity looks like a key ingredient in creating a succesfull ad campaign. David Mausolf VP, User Acquisition, FoxNext Games quotes.  
"The interactivity helped us get people excited about the game and contributed to our goal of better return on ad spend."  
  
[Kakao Games](https://www.facebook.com/business/success/kakao-games-wisebirds)

My second case study was Kakao games, what struck my interest in this company ws its use of playable ads on Facebook.  Although seemingly the most difficult ad to create this concept of a playable ad would be the most engaging model. According to their success story they ahd an 80% lower cost per click with playable ad (compared to other ads in the same campaign).  These stats are enough to convice me that playable ads are a good route for a successfull ad campaign.   
  
As I reseached Playable Ads further I discovered a business model that relativly new and mirrored some of the characteristics of my own products.  It was game based entirly around advertisments, althought the concept of making a game an advertisment is nothing new, for instance the [Cool Spot game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Spot) that was relased in 1993 by Virgin Game USA was just a big ad for Z-up.  However, the ease of making Advertisment games has been greatly reduced.  An example of a company that specialize in these Advert-Games is:

Although my idea for Creative Games is much different than an Advert-Game company it might be a lucrative direction to picvot to. 


### **Task 2: Audience Research**  
   
I began my audience reseach by implementing a Facebook Ad campaign for my Original Games page's first post.  it was a demo called Duck Runner my first prototype of this learning module.  below are some statistics that I captured from that initial ad that took place over the course of 5 days.
