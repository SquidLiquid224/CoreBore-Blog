Preliminary Work  

I began my reseach for the dissemication plan through Facebook and testing the marketing aspects of that platform. I found that creating ad campaigns are quick and easy to create at a resonable price.  After my initial testing on a Game Video Creator account I built a company page called Original Games and began an test ad campaign to find my audience.  I also found some very useful resources on the Business At [Facebook Learn](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn).  By going through this resourse I found some really good take-aways and was inspired to set up a Facebook Organization Page.  I needed to establish a presence as soon as possible and conduct more ad reseach so when my MVP is complete my ads will be effective and taget the right audience. i started the page [Original Games](https://www.facebook.com/Original-Games-104498631430111).  With this created I began my research on other competitors that are also leveraging the Facebook advertisement platform. 

Competitor Case Studies

IMy first two competitor case studies on successfull Facebook ad campaigns.  As my games will be short web based games and share many qualities to the following examples.  I have also chosen to use the facebook ad platform as my main outlet for marketing and publicity.  
  
Case Study 01:  
[FoxNext Games](https://www.facebook.com/business/success/foxnext-games)
Carosel ads   
   
Case Study 02:  
[Kakao Games](https://www.facebook.com/business/success/kakao-games-wisebirds)
Playable ads   
   
As I reseached Playable Ads further I discovered a business model that relativly new and mirrored some of the characteristics of my own products.  It was game based entirly around advertisments, althought the concept of making a game an advertisment is nothing new, for instance the [Cool Spot game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Spot) that was relased in 1993 by Virgin Game USA was just a big ad for Z-up.  However, the ease of making Advertisment games has been greatly reduced.  Two examples of companies that specialize in these Advert Games are:



Task 2: Audience Research  

If you have not done so already, carry out audience research to test assumptions about the target audience and their attitudes, knowledge, interests, preferences, or behaviours relevant to your FMP. Be sure to reference your findings within the dissemination plan.  

Dissemination Report:  

The dissemination plan must be no longer than 15 pages long (excluding references and appendix). The structure of the dissemination plan will differ depending on the product, audience and target market amongst other things. Here is a suggested structure for a tradition app. It is up to you whether to add or remove sections.
