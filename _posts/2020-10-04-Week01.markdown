Preliminary Work  

The preliminary research activities are designed to inform you approach to structuring and creating content for the dissemination plan. There is a good chance that you have already carried out tasks that can be included as part of the preliminary research. All preliminary research should be included in an appendix at the end of the plan and where appropriate referenced in the plan.  

 

Task 1: Competitor Case Studies x2  

You are not the first person to take a product to market! There are many who have come before you and they often have teams of people working to ensure the products they are promoting get into the hands of the intended audience. For this task, identify two competitors and research their approach to product dissemination. Each case study should be no longer than a single page.  

Task 2: Audience Research  

If you have not done so already, carry out audience research to test assumptions about the target audience and their attitudes, knowledge, interests, preferences, or behaviours relevant to your FMP. Be sure to reference your findings within the dissemination plan.  

Dissemination Report:  

The dissemination plan must be no longer than 15 pages long (excluding references and appendix). The structure of the dissemination plan will differ depending on the product, audience and target market amongst other things. Here is a suggested structure for a tradition app. It is up to you whether to add or remove sections.
