During the second week I took a step back from development of the Core Bore game made at the Global Game Jam.  I wanted to make sure to move this project in the right direction and get as much feedback as possible.  Although I did get some really good feedback from the jam I needed more and from a variety of age groups. 

I contacted some of my work colleagues who had children and asked them to demo the game.  My first response was amazing, my colleague from work has two younger children and a boy and a girl.  I was told that they both played the game and really enjoyed the experience!  My colleague also stopped me in the office and gave me some encouraging words as well as some business tips.  He recommended that I message my group from the Game Jam and clarify that I was going to continue work on the Core Bore game with hopes of releasing it for sales.  

I did just that, I messaged my group and clearly stated that I wanted to continue work on the project as well as post in on Steam.  I expected more of a response, only a “Woa” from one of the group members. I may have come on too strong or they just are not interested in the game anymore.  Possibly a bit of both. 

I was still very proud of the game and began conceptualizing a universe for this lowly miner and his destructive drill.  started writing a Game Brief to pitch to my Master Group.  It began with a Story Synapsis.

>An unsuspected android miner and his dog unearths an ancient relic. The relic depicts an asteroid crashing into earth releasing a devastating bug invasion. The android must now reach the core of the asteroid to detonate an explosive and save the world!

After that The Game Brief quickly grew into Character sketches and bios Game mechanic breakdowns and the beginning of a narrative.
