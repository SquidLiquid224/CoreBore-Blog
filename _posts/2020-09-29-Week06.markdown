Research and Development  
  
Critical Reflection  

1)
Did you experience a personal sense of achievement while playing any of these games? If so, do you feel that this experience could be an example of verified positivsm? meaning this sense of achievment can be researched in a quantitative manner.

2)
Do you feel that it is possible to use a game to find out ‘objective’ knowledge about society and the motives that lie behind social action?
To what extent have these these games related to your experiences in society?
